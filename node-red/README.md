# node-red

Files for the user-interface / electronics of the motorised system.

**node-red-flow.json** gives the entire 'flow' json for the user interface. Once Node-RED (https://nodered.org/) is installed,
the flow can be loaded by selecting ‘import’ from the menu, and providing this json file. 
This also requires the following nodes to be installed: node-red-dashboard
(https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard), and node-red-node-serialport
(https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-serialport)

The other directories provide images of the Node-RED setup, user interface, and box/electronics.
