# calibration

Files for the calibration setup for the EMBL motorised system, built on a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome.

Overview diagram in **BG-YS-Segmentbogen.pdf** - note that these pieces are assembled in different configurations to 
calibrate the knife tilt, sample rotation and sample tilt (see images in the corresponding folders). This diagram shows the 
setup for the sample tilt calibration. CAD files (.STEP) are provided for the labelled pieces in this diagram in the CAD folder.
Note the additional '30-YS-0006-00.STEP' file - this piece is only used in the knife tilt and sample rotation calibration, and so
isn't shown in this diagram.
